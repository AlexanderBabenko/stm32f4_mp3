# stm32f4_mp3

This is my test implementation of MP3 USB player on board STM32F407-discovery and Helix MP3 decoder.
Player can play MP3 files from the USB stick connected to USB port on discovery board
no additional external wires or buttons are used.
Currently it plays only MP3 files, in future I'm going to add WMA decoder.
